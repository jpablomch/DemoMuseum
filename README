LFD Aibo

There is a bug in Ubuntu. You need to make the window bigger. Also, the order of the buttons is reversed. 

To compile go inside the folder and,
$ javac *.java

To run the program the AIBO has to be ready and the computer running the program has to be connected to aibonet. Then go inside the folder AiboL... and,
$ java AiboLFD -lfd

When you run it, the program is going to create a few sockets. To end the program press the key "q" so the program closes all the ports and you can run it again without having to restart the AIBO. 
There is a bug that causes a problem when you try to run the program again. If the programs stops and prints this:
"Opening ports
Reached here"
Just run the program again and it will run fine. I am going to fix this bug in January. Feel free to fix it if you want.

When the program is running you have a few options pressing the following keys:

q - end the program

w - makes the AIBO walk straight or stop if it is working 

Right Arrow - rotate right

Left Arrow - rotate 

s - Starts the Learning from Demonstration
